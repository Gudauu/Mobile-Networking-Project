## 1. OVERVIEW
A class project for the mobile networking course at Fudan University.

While it's far from being a market-standard app (people are so demanding these days), it's compact and fully functioning.

## 2. WHAT CAN IT DO
It's a "location-based-wall" social app. 
Users can post pictures, videos, and text content as well as view others' posts within a specified range.  
Worth mentioning side functionalities include commenting, account creation / login, profile customization, app auto-update, and admin privileges.  

## 3. TECH STACK
- **Apk**: standard Android SDK with Java in Android Studio    
- **Account management** (including authentication): Firebase    
- **Server**: AWS free-tier EC2 VPS (yes, I'm a poor student)  
- **Backend**: MongoDB + NodeJS  
- **Map**: Google Maps API

## 4. CAVEATS
When my colleague and I were working on this project, we were also preparing for our graduate thesis, so it was kind of rushed through.
You'll probably find out that some (quite a lot, I admit) backend Java classes and variables are badly structured. 

## 5. INSTALLATION
So far, we haven't uploaded the app to any Android app markets. Instead, we're hosting it on our own server.
### Prerequisites
- An Android device
- Network connection
- Willingness to grant network, storage, and location permissions (yes, I'm afraid)

### STEPS
1. Download the APK [here](http://54.252.196.140:3000/apk/download) on your Android device.
2. If the installation process doesn't start automatically, find the APK in your download history and click on it to install.
3. You might need to check the "permit installation from unknown sources" option in settings.

### UPDATE
If you've already installed the app and want to check for available updates, go to "HOME" and click the "CHECK UPDATES" button. The newest APK (if it exists) will be fetched and installed automatically.

## 6. DEMO
We created a CANVA slide [here](https://www.canva.com/design/DAFki1f8MRk/o91gEmSHyx54K05FOiLGIQ/view?utm_content=DAFki1f8MRk&utm_campaign=designshare&utm_medium=link&utm_source=publishsharelink) when we made the final presentation. The text is in Mandarin, but you can simply check some screenshots and screen recordings.

## 7. STATUS
Up and running. Suggestions and comments are welcome!
